# Product Requirements Document: High Resolution Image Analysis for Pro Users

## Introduction/Overview

This feature provides enhanced AI analysis capabilities for Pro subscribers by implementing high-resolution image processing, removing usage limitations, and offering advanced AI models. Non-Pro users retain existing functionality while Pro users receive significantly improved analysis quality and unlimited usage.

**Problem Solved**: Pro users need superior AI analysis quality for accurate inventory documentation, especially for high-value items requiring detailed detection of serial numbers, model information, and product specifications.

**Goal**: Differentiate Pro subscription value by providing premium AI analysis capabilities while removing artificial usage constraints for all users.

## Goals

1. Provide Pro users with high-resolution (1250x1250px) image processing for superior AI analysis
2. Upgrade Pro users to advanced AI models (gpt-5-mini) with high detail parameters
3. Remove the 50 AI analysis limit for all users (Pro and non-Pro)
4. Add Pro-only settings control for quality preferences
5. Implement comprehensive analytics tracking for usage insights
6. Maintain backward compatibility and seamless user experience
7. Follow latest OpenAI Vision API standards

## User Stories

1. **As a Pro user documenting valuable items**, I want high-resolution AI analysis so that serial numbers, model numbers, and fine details are accurately detected and recorded.

2. **As a Pro user with performance needs**, I want the ability to toggle high-quality mode on/off so that I can choose between speed and quality based on my current needs.

3. **As a non-Pro user**, I want unlimited AI analyses so that I'm not artificially restricted in documenting my inventory.

4. **As any user**, I want the AI analysis to use the latest OpenAI API format so that I receive the most accurate and up-to-date results.

5. **As a product manager**, I want detailed analytics on AI usage patterns so that I can understand user behavior and optimize the feature.

## Functional Requirements

### Pro User High-Resolution Processing
1. Pro users must have images processed at 1250x1250 pixel resolution before sending to OpenAI
2. Images must be cropped to square aspect ratio prior to resizing to maintain consistency
3. Pro users must use the `gpt-5-mini` AI model for enhanced accuracy
4. Pro users must use "high" detail parameter for maximum analysis quality
5. High-quality processing must be enabled by default for Pro users

### Non-Pro User Standard Processing  
6. Non-Pro users must continue using existing 512x512 pixel resolution
7. Non-Pro users must continue using `gpt-5` AI model
8. Non-Pro users must use "low" detail parameter as currently implemented
9. Standard processing behavior must remain unchanged for backward compatibility

### Usage Limit Removal
10. The 50 AI analysis limit must be removed for all users (Pro and non-Pro)
11. The progress indicator showing usage count must be removed from the settings view
12. Any related UI elements indicating analysis limits must be removed or updated

### Pro Settings Control
13. A new "AI Analysis" section must be added to settings for Pro users
14. Pro users must have a toggle to "Enable High Quality Analysis" (default: ON)
15. When disabled, Pro users must use the same parameters as non-Pro users (speed optimization)
16. Non-Pro users must see the toggle but in a disabled state with explanatory text
17. The toggle must clearly indicate it's a Pro-only feature

### OpenAI API Compliance
18. All API calls must use the latest OpenAI Vision API "Responses" format
19. Error handling must be updated for new API response structures
20. Retry logic must work with the new API format

### Analytics and Tracking
21. Each AI analysis must be tracked via TelemetryDeck with metadata including:
    - User Pro status (Pro/Free)
    - Image resolution used (1250x1250 or 512x512)
    - AI model used (gpt-5-mini or gpt-5)
    - Detail parameter used (high/low)
    - Analysis success/failure status
    - Response time metrics
22. Multiple analysis attempts on the same item must be tracked separately
23. High-quality toggle usage patterns must be tracked

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Custom image resolution selection - fixed at 1250x1250 for Pro, 512x512 for standard
2. Manual AI model selection - automatic based on Pro status
3. Other Pro feature implementations not related to image analysis
4. Changes to RevenueCat subscription logic or Pro detection
5. UI redesigns beyond the necessary settings additions
6. Performance optimizations unrelated to image processing
7. Integration with other AI services beyond OpenAI

## Design Considerations

- Maintain existing app visual design language and patterns
- Settings toggle should follow iOS standard toggle design
- High-quality processing should be transparent to users (no different UI during analysis)
- Error states should gracefully fall back to standard processing if needed
- Loading states should remain consistent regardless of processing quality
- Pro badge or indicator should be subtle and not overwhelming

## Technical Considerations

### Image Processing Pipeline
- Extend OptimizedImageManager to support dual-resolution processing
- Implement efficient image resizing algorithms to maintain quality at 1250x1250
- Ensure memory management for larger image processing
- Maintain existing square cropping functionality

### Settings Management
- Extend SettingsManager with new highQualityAnalysisEnabled property
- Implement computed properties for effective resolution/model based on Pro status and setting
- Ensure settings persistence across app launches
- Handle migration for existing users (default to enabled for Pro users)

### OpenAI Service Updates  
- Update OpenAIService to dynamically select model and parameters based on user status
- Implement new API response format handling
- Update error handling and retry logic for new API structure
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Analytics Integration
- Extend TelemetryManager with new analysis tracking methods
- Implement detailed metadata collection without performance impact
- Ensure user privacy compliance in tracking implementation

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new settings management functionality
- Tests for dynamic model/parameter selection logic
- Integration tests for Pro vs non-Pro behavior differences
- Performance tests for high-resolution image processing
- Analytics tracking verification tests

## Success Metrics

1. **Pro User Engagement**: 85% of Pro users keep high-quality mode enabled after 30 days
2. **Analysis Quality**: 40% improvement in serial number detection accuracy for Pro users
3. **Usage Growth**: 200% increase in total AI analyses within 60 days of limit removal
4. **Performance**: High-resolution processing completes within 120% of standard processing time
5. **Error Rate**: Less than 2% increase in analysis failures with high-resolution processing
6. **User Satisfaction**: Pro users report improved analysis accuracy in feedback

## Open Questions

1. Should there be any visual indication during analysis that high-quality processing is being used?
2. How should we handle cases where high-quality processing fails but standard processing might succeed?
3. Should we implement any client-side image quality validation before sending to OpenAI?
4. Do we need any rate limiting or throttling for high-resolution processing to manage costs?
5. Should the settings toggle have additional context or help text explaining the trade-offs?
6. How should we communicate the feature improvement to existing Pro users?
