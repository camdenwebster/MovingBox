## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Settings Management Enhancement
  - [ ] 1.1 Add `highQualityAnalysisEnabled: Bool` property to SettingsManager
  - [ ] 1.2 Implement computed properties for effective resolution/model based on Pro status
  - [ ] 1.3 Add settings persistence and default value handling (enabled for Pro users)
  - [ ] 1.4 Create helper methods for Pro feature detection and toggle availability
  - [ ] 1.5 Update settings migration logic for new property

- [ ] 2.0 Image Processing Pipeline Updates
  - [ ] 2.1 Extend OptimizedImageManager with dual-resolution processing capability
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement efficient 1250x1250 image resizing with quality preservation
  - [ ] 2.3 Add memory management optimizations for high-resolution processing
  - [ ] 2.4 Maintain backward compatibility with existing 512x512 processing

- [ ] 3.0 OpenAI Service Modernization
  - [ ] 3.1 Update to latest OpenAI Vision API "Responses" format
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement dynamic model selection (gpt-5-mini for Pro, gpt-5 for standard)
  - [ ] 3.3 Add dynamic detail parameter selection ("high" for Pro, "low" for standard)
  - [ ] 3.4 Update error handling and retry logic for new API format
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement graceful fallback from high-quality to standard processing
  - [ ] 3.6 Add performance monitoring and response time tracking

- [ ] 4.0 Settings UI Updates
  - [ ] 4.1 Create new "AI Analysis" section in SettingsView
  - [ ] 4.2 Add "Enable High Quality Analysis" toggle with Pro-only availability
  - [ ] 4.3 Remove 50 AI analysis progress indicator and related UI elements
  - [ ] 4.4 Add explanatory text for non-Pro users about Pro-only features
  - [ ] 4.5 Implement proper toggle state management and visual feedback

- [ ] 5.0 Analytics and Tracking
  - [ ] 5.1 Add TelemetryDeck events for AI analysis with metadata (Pro status, resolution, model)
  - [ ] 5.2 Track high-quality toggle usage patterns and preferences
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement per-item analysis tracking for multiple attempts detection
  - [ ] 5.4 Add performance metrics tracking (response times, success rates)

- [ ] 6.0 Testing and Validation
  - [ ] 6.1 Create comprehensive unit test suite for new settings management
  - [ ] 6.2 Add integration tests for Pro vs non-Pro behavior differences
  - [ ] 6.3 Test high-resolution image processing performance and memory usage
  - [ ] 6.4 Validate OpenAI API format updates and error handling
  - [ ] 6.5 Test settings UI behavior for Pro and non-Pro users
  - [ ] 6.6 Run full regression testing to ensure backward compatibility

## Technical Notes

- Uses SwiftUI with SwiftData for persistence (not Core Data)
- Swift Testing framework for unit tests (not XCTest for unit tests)
- Existing Pro feature detection via `AppConfig.shared.isPro`
- RevenueCat integration already handles subscription management
- TelemetryDeck already integrated for analytics
- Existing OptimizedImageManager handles image compression and storage
- Current OpenAI service uses structured responses with retry logic

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Pro users automatically receive high-resolution processing (1250x1250px)
- [ ] Pro users use gpt-5-mini model with "high" detail parameter
- [ ] Non-Pro users continue with existing 512x512px, gpt-5, "low" detail
- [ ] 50 AI analysis limit completely removed from all UI
- [ ] Pro-only toggle works correctly with proper access control
- [ ] All analytics tracking provides detailed insights
- [ ] No performance regression for standard processing
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
