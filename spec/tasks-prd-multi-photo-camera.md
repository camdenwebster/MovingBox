### Notes

- The SwiftUI project uses SwiftData instead of Core Data for persistence
- Tests use Swift Testing framework, not Jest
- UI tests should follow the existing page object model pattern in the Screens/ directory
- All image handling should leverage the existing OptimizedImageManager patterns
