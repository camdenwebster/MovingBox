# Product Requirements Document: PDF/Printable Report Feature

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enables MovingBox users to generate professional, printable PDF reports of their home inventory for insurance documentation, records management, and sharing purposes. The feature provides a comprehensive, professionally formatted document that includes detailed item listings, photos, and organized summaries by location.

**Problem Solved**: Users need a way to create professional, printable documentation of their home inventory for insurance claims, moving purposes, estate planning, and general record-keeping. The current CSV export lacks visual elements and professional formatting necessary for these use cases.

**Goal**: Provide users with a comprehensive PDF export capability that transforms their digital inventory into professional, printable documents suitable for insurance, legal, and personal documentation needs.

## Goals

1. **Professional Documentation**: Generate insurance-quality PDF reports with proper formatting, page numbers, and table of contents
2. **Visual Inventory Records**: Include scaled item photos alongside detailed specifications for visual identification
3. **Organized Presentation**: Structure reports by location with alphabetical item sorting for easy reference
4. **User-Friendly Access**: Integrate seamlessly into existing share workflow via enhanced share sheet menu
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all inventory metadata, valuation summaries, and home details
6. **Background Processing**: Generate reports asynchronously to prevent UI blocking for large inventories
7. **Cross-Device Availability**: Leverage iCloud document sync for report access across user devices

## User Stories

1. **As a homeowner preparing insurance documentation**, I want to generate a comprehensive PDF report of my inventory so that I have professional documentation for insurance purposes.

2. **As a user moving to a new home**, I want a printable inventory report so that I can easily track and verify all my belongings during the moving process.

3. **As someone managing estate planning**, I want detailed PDF reports with photos and valuations so that I can provide comprehensive asset documentation.

4. **As a user with a large inventory**, I want the PDF generation to happen in the background so that I can continue using the app while my report is being prepared.

5. **As a user sharing inventory information**, I want to access my generated reports from any device so that I can quickly share documentation when needed.

6. **As a user organizing by location**, I want my PDF report to be structured by room/location so that I can easily find and reference specific areas of my home.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### PDF Generation Engine
- **Technology**: SwiftUI ImageRenderer + PDFKit for iOS 16+ compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Multi-page renderer approach for efficient memory usage
- **Content Layout**: Fixed letter size (612x792 points) with responsive item pagination
- **Styling**: Reuse existing SwiftUI components for visual consistency

#### Data Models
```swift
@Model
class GeneratedReport {
    var id: UUID
    var title: String
    var dateCreated: Date
    var itemCount: Int
    var locationCount: Int
    var status: ReportStatus  // .generating, .completed, .failed
    var fileURL: URL?
    var fileSize: Int64
    var totalValue: Decimal
}
```

#### Background Processing Architecture
- **Coordinator**: `@MainActor ReportCoordinator` manages generation workflow and user interaction
- **Generator**: `actor PDFGenerator` handles heavy processing tasks off main thread
- **Workflow**: Create metadata placeholder → background generation → update with results → notification

#### File Management System
- **Storage Location**: Documents directory (`/Documents/Reports/{reportId}.pdf`)
- **iCloud Integration**: Automatic sync via existing document-based setup
- **URL Management**: Consistent URL-based approach matching current photo storage patterns

### User Experience Flow

#### Report Generation Process
1. User taps "Export PDF" from enhanced share sheet menu
2. Report immediately appears in reports list with "generating" status
3. Background processing begins with progress indication
4. Local notification fired when generation completes
5. Status updates to "completed" with file size and summary information
6. User can access report for viewing/sharing from reports list or notification

#### Report Access & Management
- **Discovery**: Bottom toolbar button launches reports list sheet
- **Interaction**: Tap report row to open iOS share sheet for viewing/sharing
- **Persistence**: Reports remain available across devices via iCloud sync
- **Organization**: Reports sorted by creation date with clear metadata display
