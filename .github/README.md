## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

#### Self-Hosted Runners (Orchard/Tart)
- **OS**: macOS with Xcode 16.2+
- **CPU**: 8+ cores recommended
- **Memory**: 32GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: 500GB+ SSD
- **Network**: High-bandwidth connection

#### Required Tools
- Xcode 16.2 or later
- Fastlane (latest)
- Claude Code CLI
- iOS Simulators
- Git and GitHub CLI

### Environment Setup

#### 1. Configure Secrets
See [SECRETS_SETUP.md](SECRETS_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**Required for all builds:**
```bash
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
REVENUE_CAT_API_KEY=<your-revenue-cat-key>
SENTRY_DSN=<your-sentry-dsn>
TELEMETRY_DECK_APP_ID=<your-telemetry-id>
```

**Required for releases:**
```bash
KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD=<keychain-password>
CERTIFICATES_P12=<base64-encoded-certificates>
CERTIFICATES_PASSWORD=<certificate-password>
PROVISIONING_PROFILE=<base64-encoded-profile>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID=<api-key-id>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=<issuer-id>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-encoded-private-key>

- **production**: Maintainer approval + release branch only

#### 4. Branch Protection
Set up branch protection rules:
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks (CI pipeline)
- Restrict pushes to main branch
- Require up-to-date branches
