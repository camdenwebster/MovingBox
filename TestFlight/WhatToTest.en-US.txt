We are excited to prepare for our 1.0 launch, and we will greatly appreciate any help we can get testing the following features:

- Updating existing inventory records with AI (either the "Anlayze with AI" button or the "sparkle" button in an existing inventory record)
- Analyzing a wide variety of items
- Testing on a wide variety of iPhone models
