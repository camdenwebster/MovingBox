Thank you for testing the latest build of MovingBox!

We are excited to prepare for our 1.0 launch, and we will greatly appreciate any help we can get testing the following features:
- Creating new inventory records from the Camera view (can be accessed from the "Add Item" tab)
- Updating existing inventory records with AI (either the "Anlayze with AI" button or the "sparkle" button in an existing inventory record)
- Analyzing a wide variety of items
- Testing on a wide variety of iPhone models
