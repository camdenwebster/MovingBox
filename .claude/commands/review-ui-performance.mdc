# Review UI Performance

Analyze SwiftUI views and app performance for optimization opportunities.

## Performance Areas to Check

1. **View Rendering**: Identify expensive computations in view body
2. **Image Loading**: Check OptimizedImageManager usage and caching
3. **SwiftData Queries**: Review fetch requests and predicates
4. **Navigation Performance**: Analyze Router navigation patterns
5. **Memory Usage**: Check for retain cycles and memory leaks

## Tools and Techniques

1. **Xcode Instruments**: Profile CPU, Memory, and Core Data usage
2. **SwiftUI Preview Performance**: Check preview compilation times
3. **App Launch Time**: Measure cold start performance  
4. **Animation Performance**: Check 60fps maintenance during transitions

## Key Files to Review

- `MovingBox/Views/` - All SwiftUI views for optimization
- `MovingBox/Services/OptimizedImageManager.swift` - Image performance
- `MovingBox/Services/Router.swift` - Navigation performance
- `MovingBox/Models/` - SwiftData model efficiency

## Performance Testing

```bash
# Run performance tests
xcodebuild test -project MovingBox.xcodeproj -scheme MovingBoxTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' -only-testing:MovingBoxTests/MovingBoxPerformanceTests
```

## Common Optimizations

- Move expensive operations out of view body
- Use `@StateObject` vs `@ObservedObject` correctly
- Implement proper image caching strategies
- Optimize SwiftData fetch requests with predicates
- Use lazy loading for large lists
- Implement proper async/await patterns
