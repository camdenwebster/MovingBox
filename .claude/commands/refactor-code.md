# Refactor Code

Refactor the code in the specified file/module to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to iOS best practices: $ARGUMENTS

## Refactoring Objectives

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Readability**: Make code easier to understand and maintain
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Use Swift's protocol-oriented approach where appropriate
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminate code duplication and extract common patterns

### iOS-Specific Patterns
- **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Optimize view composition and state management
- **SwiftData Optimization**: Improve model relationships and query patterns
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Enhance async/await usage and actor implementations
- **Memory Management**: Improve retain cycles and memory usage patterns

## Pre-Refactoring Analysis

### Code Assessment
1. **Identify Code Smells**: Look for long methods, large classes, duplicated code
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: Review coupling between components
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Identify performance bottlenecks
4. **Review Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage before refactoring

### Impact Analysis
1. **Breaking Changes**: Identify potential breaking changes to public APIs
2. **Dependency Impact**: Analyze effects on dependent code
3. **Testing Requirements**: Plan testing strategy for refactored code
4. **Migration Path**: Consider gradual vs. comprehensive refactoring approach

## Refactoring Strategies

### Structural Improvements
- **Extract Methods**: Break down large methods into smaller, focused ones
- **Extract Classes/Protocols**: Separate concerns into dedicated types
- **Rename Variables**: Use clear, descriptive names
- **Organize Imports**: Clean up and organize import statements

### SwiftUI Refactoring
- **View Decomposition**: Break large views into smaller, reusable components
- **State Management**: Optimize @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject usage
- **Custom Modifiers**: Extract common view modifications
- **Environment Optimization**: Improve environment object usage

### Service Layer Refactoring
- **Protocol Extraction**: Define clear service interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Improve testability through DI patterns
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling approaches
- **Async Patterns**: Optimize async/await and actor usage

### Model Refactoring
- **SwiftData Optimization**: Improve model relationships and queries
- **Validation Logic**: Extract and centralize validation
- **Computed Properties**: Use computed properties for derived data
- **Protocol Conformance**: Implement appropriate protocols (Codable, Equatable, etc.)

## Safety Measures

### Preserve Functionality
- **Behavior Preservation**: Ensure refactoring doesn't change external behavior
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain public API contracts where possible
- **Data Integrity**: Preserve data consistency during model refactoring
- **Performance Maintenance**: Avoid performance regressions

### Testing Strategy
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Ensure all refactored code is tested
- **Before/After Testing**: Run tests before and after refactoring
- **Integration Testing**: Verify system integration after changes
- **Performance Testing**: Confirm performance characteristics are maintained

## Refactoring Process

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Create Feature Branch**: Work on dedicated branch for refactoring
2. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure all tests pass before starting
3. **Document Current Behavior**: Record expected behavior for verification
4. **Plan Incremental Steps**: Break refactoring into small, verifiable steps

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. **Small Steps**: Make incremental changes and test frequently
2. **Maintain Green Tests**: Keep tests passing throughout process
3. **Commit Frequently**: Create checkpoint commits for easy rollback
4. **Review Progress**: Regularly assess refactoring progress and quality

### Phase 3: Validation
1. **Full Test Suite**: Run complete test suite after refactoring
2. **Code Review**: Have refactored code reviewed by team members
3. **Performance Verification**: Confirm performance characteristics
4. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation

## MovingBox-Specific Refactoring Areas

### SwiftUI Views
- **View Hierarchy**: Optimize view composition and nesting
- **State Management**: Improve data flow and state handling
- **Navigation Integration**: Enhance Router integration patterns
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility implementation

### Services
- **OpenAIService**: Optimize API integration patterns
- **DataManager**: Improve export/import functionality
- **Image Management**: Enhance OptimizedImageManager usage
- **Error Handling**: Standardize service error patterns

### Models
- **SwiftData Relationships**: Optimize model relationships
- **Migration Patterns**: Improve data migration implementations
- **Validation Logic**: Extract and centralize validation
- **Protocol Conformance**: Enhance protocol implementations

### Navigation
- **Router Enhancement**: Improve navigation patterns
- **Deep Linking**: Optimize deep link handling
- **State Management**: Enhance navigation state management
- **Tab Coordination**: Improve tab-based navigation

## Code Quality Metrics

### Readability Improvements
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity
- Improve method and class naming
- Add meaningful comments where necessary
- Organize code structure logically

### Maintainability Enhancements
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve modularity and separation of concerns
- Enhance testability through better design
- Simplify complex algorithms and logic

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize memory usage patterns
- Improve computational efficiency
- Reduce unnecessary object allocations
- Enhance concurrent processing where appropriate

## Documentation Updates

### Code Documentation
- Update inline comments and documentation
- Refresh README files if architecture changes
- Update API documentation for public interfaces
- Document new patterns and conventions

### Team Knowledge Sharing
- Document refactoring decisions and rationale
- Share new patterns with team members
- Update coding guidelines if new patterns emerge
- Create examples of improved patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Pre-Commit Checks
- Run all unit tests and ensure they pass
- Execute UI tests for affected functionality
- Perform code linting and style checking
- Verify build succeeds in all configurations

### Post-Refactoring Validation
- Monitor app performance in testing
- Verify all functionality works as expected
- Check for any unintended side effects
- Validate user-facing features thoroughly

Remember:
- **Refactor fearlessly but responsibly** - tests provide safety net
- **Maintain functionality** - refactoring should not change behavior
- **Small steps** - incremental changes are safer and easier to review
- **Test continuously** - keep tests green throughout the process
- **Document decisions** - help future developers understand the changes
