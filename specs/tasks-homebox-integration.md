## Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions
- Use URLSession for HTTP communication with HomeBox API
- Leverage SwiftData change tracking for sync optimization
- Implement actor-based sync service for thread safety
- Use structured concurrency (async/await) throughout sync operations
- Store sync metadata alongside existing model properties

### Security Considerations
- All API communications use HTTPS only
- Credentials stored in iOS Keychain with appropriate access controls
- Authentication tokens have automatic refresh mechanisms
- User can revoke access and clear credentials at any time

### Performance Considerations
- Batch API operations where possible to reduce network calls
- Implement intelligent sync scheduling based on app usage patterns
- Use background app refresh for sync operations
- Compress and optimize photos before upload to HomeBox
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when HomeBox server is unavailable
- Comprehensive error messaging for user understanding
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Sync queue preservation during network outages
- Conflict resolution with user notification when needed
