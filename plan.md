## Planning Guidelines

### For Product Manager Claude
When using this file for feature planning:
1. **Explore First**: Understand the current codebase thoroughly
2. **Think Hard**: Consider multiple approaches and trade-offs
3. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable steps
4. **Consider Integration**: How new features fit with existing architecture
5. **Plan for Testing**: Include comprehensive testing strategy
6. **Document Decisions**: Record rationale for major design decisions

### For Developer Claude
When reviewing plans before implementation:
1. **Validate Feasibility**: Ensure technical approach is sound
2. **Identify Gaps**: Look for missing details or unconsidered scenarios
3. **Estimate Effort**: Provide realistic timeline estimates
4. **Suggest Improvements**: Offer alternative approaches if beneficial
5. **Plan Incrementally**: Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

### For Review Process
Before starting implementation:
1. **Team Review**: Have relevant team members review the plan
2. **Stakeholder Approval**: Get approval from product/business stakeholders
3. **Technical Validation**: Verify technical approach with senior developers
4. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure necessary resources are available
5. **Timeline Alignment**: Confirm timeline fits with project priorities

## Best Practices

### Planning Principles
- **Start with Why**: Clearly define the problem being solved
- **Think User-First**: Consider impact on user experience
- **Design for Maintainability**: Plan for long-term code health
- **Consider Scalability**: Think about future growth and changes
- **Plan for Failure**: Include error handling and recovery strategies

### MovingBox-Specific Considerations
- **AI Integration**: How does this interact with OpenAI services
- **Subscription Model**: Consider free vs pro feature placement
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure user data protection and privacy
- **Performance**: Consider impact on app performance and battery life
- **Accessibility**: Plan for accessibility features and compliance

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation current and useful
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection
